 I'm highly interested in learning just about anything code related. Right now I'm learning tkinter and how to use it to develop a modern python gui for my senior capstone project. Currently, I am doing project based learning, which involves creating projects with the languages/tools that I want to develop my skills in. I am planning to do project based learning with Python and Frontend Development. After I complete a project, I will add my own spin on the project to make it partially my own.
