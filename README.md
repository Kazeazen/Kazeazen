- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kazeazen, or James Thomason
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development, Backend Development, Data Science, Data Engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently in my last semester at the University of Arizona. I am set to graduate in May 2022.
- 💞️ I have experience in OOP, Front End Development, Beginner Back End Development with NodeJS/Express, MongoDB, SQL, R, AWS Cloud services, and various other technologies.
- 📫 Contact me at jamesthomason6152@gmail.com 
 
 I'm highly interested in learning just about anything code related. I am currently looking for a full-time opportunity as of May 13th. I'm very motivated to work as a backend developer, however, any type of software development role is the exact type of opportunity I am looking for and I will not pass any of them up.
